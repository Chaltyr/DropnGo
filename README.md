This is the final project of the Full-Stack Web Development course at NEXT Academy during the December 2019 - February 2020 intake. 

It is an app that named Drop-n-Go. The app is targeted at users who want to quickly find a place to store their luggage, bags or items. 

The flow of the app goes as follows:
1. user signs up for an account and then signs in. 
2. User then selects the location that they are in.
3. User is then directed to a page listing all Drop-n-Go affiliated/partnered shops and establishments where they can select based on the prices etc.
4. User selects the place, duration of storage, number of luggage and is then given an estimated price for the storage service. 
5. User must then pay for the storage fees on their phone after which they will get a booking listed on their profile page as well as a qr code. Then they will make their way to the storage spot. 
6. Once there, the user lets the vendor scan the qr code to confirm their booking, the vendor will store away the user's luggage.
7. When the user is ready to pick up their luggage, they will need to return to the storage spot, allow the vendor to scan the qr code again to confirm the booking, before recieving their luggage again. 

This app was made possible by the combined efforts of my team affectionately named Team Go here at NEXT Academy. The team members include, Andrew, Ben, Shafiq, Hui Min, and myself(Louis). 

* Please note that the app is launched on Heroku.com, so when visiting the app at http://drop-and-go.herokuapp.com/, do refresh once or twice as the Heroku servers take about 30 seconds to start up.
